### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I am a front-end programmer with minimal back-end knowledge. I love learning new technologies and I'm always taking a course in the field to increase my knowledge. :heart:

:star: &nbsp; Lately, I've been studying hard to become a full-stack developer, improving my knowledge about the back end.
<br/> :computer: &nbsp; Front-End Stack: Html5, Css3, JavaScript, BootStrap
<br/> :bulb: &nbsp; I can help with any question, if it's within my knowledge.
<br/> :woman: &nbsp; About me: I love watching anime and series on Netflix, especially with friends, I also love taking technology courses. My language is Portuguese, but I speak English and I'm learning Japanese.
